##semaphore-python
================

A python wrapper for Semaphore, a Shallow Semantic Parser that identifies roles in a text.

#How it can be used:

The detailed description of what Semaphore is and does, i.e, a description of its scientific uses can be found here: [http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/COLI_a_00163]. 

Dipanjan Das, Andre Martins, Nathan Schneider, Desai Chen, & Noah A. Smith Language Technologies Institute, Carnegie Mellon University [http://www.ark.cs.cmu.edu/SEMAFOR]

Thus, I will not describe the scientific uses here, but simply how to use the program and the reasons for this Python wrapper.
